Our scenario is a small counseling center where counselors hold both regular, group meetings and as-needed one-on-one sessions. The counselors should be able to use this program to schedule their own meetings, with occasional intervention from the admin. Patients can also use the program to check the calendar, although they will not be able to make any changes. The purpose of this program is to increase awareness of relevant information of a meeting.

The key functionalities of this system are:
?	Schedule/ plan meetings
?	Monitor meetings, especially held in a distributed environment
?	Re-planning of meetings to support changing user constraints
?	Support conflict resolution
?	Keep participants informed of the meeting schedules and any changes
?	Cancel Meeting
